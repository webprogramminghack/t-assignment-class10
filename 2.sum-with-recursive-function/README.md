# Recursive Function to Sum Numbers in Nested Arrays

## Objective

Learn how to use recursion in JavaScript by implementing a function that calculates the sum of all numbers within a deeply nested array. This assignment will help you understand how to work with recursive functions to process nested data structures, specifically arrays within arrays.

## Instructions

### 1. Implement a Recursive Function

You will implement a function called `sumNestedArray` that:

- Accepts an array as its parameter.
- Iterates through each element in the array.
- If the element is an array, it should recursively call itself on this sub-array and add the result to the running total.
- If the element is a number, it should be added to the running total.

### 2. Handle Different Levels of Nesting

Ensure that the function can handle arrays nested to any depth and still correctly sum all the numbers.

### 3. Test the `sumNestedArray` Function

Test the function by calling it with various nested array structures and verify that it correctly calculates the total sum of all numbers.

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s how your code should be structured:

```javascript
// Step 1: Create a nested array structure
let numbers = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7, [[8], 9], 10];

// Step 2: Implement the recursive function
function sumNestedArray(arr) {
  // Your recursive code goes here
}

// Step 3: Test the sumNestedArray function
let totalSum = sumNestedArray(numbers);
console.log(totalSum); // Should calculate and return the sum of all numbers
```
